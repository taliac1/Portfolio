How do I approach designing software?
	When it comes to designing software is it analyze what needs to be done and subcategories of those things to be done

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I learned how to pace myself better and create a layout of when to do each task instead of having to do it all at once.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I did a scrum based design process while I do not have a team. I like the idea of categorizing what needs to be done by difficulty and importance.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This design approach is used in a lot of scrum teams. So in most software development work I 100% will be using it.

How do I approach developing programs?
Similar to designing software is to figure out what the problem is. What needs to be done and categorize what needs to be done.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I didn't really use any new strategies.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My C++ skills have definitely improved. I personally struggled with c++ for awhile, but this course helped me fill in those gaps of things i didn't know how to do in c++.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I wish to become a software engineer so computer science is the key to that.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This definitely helps expand my knowledge in the computer science field.
